Small demo for showing how to enable or disable a set of background jobs in a Razor page.

- Jobs are here: [Jobs](https://github.com/adamfoneil/MultiCron/tree/master/MultiCron/Jobs)
- page is here: [Page](https://github.com/adamfoneil/MultiCron/blob/master/MultiCron/Pages/Index.cshtml), with [code behind](https://github.com/adamfoneil/MultiCron/blob/master/MultiCron/Pages/Index.cshtml.cs)
- jobs added at [startup](https://github.com/adamfoneil/MultiCron/blob/master/MultiCron/Program.cs#L10), calling this: [JobSetup](https://github.com/adamfoneil/MultiCron/blob/master/MultiCron/JobSetup.cs)
